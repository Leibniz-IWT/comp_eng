    "# Chapter 14 Reinforcement Learning based Orbit Station-Keeping\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "In this project you will train an agent with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to perform **station-keeping** in a realistic orbital environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The satellite must counteract small perturbations (e.g. drag) while staying within tight position constraints and minimizing fuel consumption (Δv).\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom Gymnasium environment, reward function, and helper utilities are provided in the `station_model` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Files (all in `project_handout/`)\n",
    "- [`RL_Station_Keeping_Handout.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Leibniz-IWT/comp_eng/blob/main/project_handout/RL_Station_Keeping_Handout.ipynb) → Main exercises / your working notebook\n",
    "- `coordinate system sketch.ipynb` → Reference for coordinate system visualization\n",
    "- `RL_Station_Sub_Problem_1.ipynb` → Special notebook for Sub-Problem 1 (data exploration)\n",
    "- `RL_Station_Sub_Problem_2.ipynb` → Special notebook for Sub-Problem 2 (attitude control)\n",
    "- `station_model/` → Python package (core code):\n",
    "  - `_environment.py` → The main model code\n",
    "  - `_sub_problem.py` → Helper functions for sub-problems\n",
    "  - `_hidden_functions.py` → Simulated data for noisy thrusters and drag\n",
    "  - `__init__.py`\n",
    "- `constrained_ppo_orbit.zip`, `my_fancy_system_name_improved.zip` → Pre-generated data/models (will be unzipped automatically)\n",

    "## How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended – Free GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the Colab badge for the launcher (or any notebook).\n",
    "2. **Enable GPU**:\n",
    "   - Menu: **Runtime → Change runtime type**\n",
    "   - Hardware accelerator → **T4 GPU** (or A100 if available)\n",
    "   - Save\n",
    "3. Run the setup cell at the very top (clones repo, installs packages, adds `station_model` to Python path, unzips data).\n",
    "4. Verify GPU is active:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import torch\n",
    "   print(\"GPU available:\", torch.cuda.is_available())\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Should print True\n",
    "Training will be significantly faster on GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Locally / Offline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Terminal / PowerShell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd path/to/comp_eng/project_handout\n",
    "conda activate compeng\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No extra installation steps needed if you already followed the course environment setup.\n",
    "\n"
