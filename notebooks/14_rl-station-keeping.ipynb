    "# Chapter 14 Reinforcement Learning based Orbit Station-Keeping\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "In this project you will train an agent with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to perform **station-keeping** in a realistic orbital environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The satellite must counteract small perturbations (e.g. drag) while staying within tight position constraints and minimizing fuel consumption (Δv).\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom Gymnasium environment, reward function, and helper utilities are provided in the `station_model` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Files (all in `project_handout/`)\n",
    "- [`RL_Station_Keeping_Handout.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Leibniz-IWT/comp_eng/blob/main/project_handout/RL_Station_Keeping_Handout.ipynb) → Main exercises / your working notebook\n",
    "- `coordinate system sketch.ipynb` → Reference for coordinate system visualization\n",
    "- `RL_Station_Sub_Problem_1.ipynb` → Special notebook for Sub-Problem 1 (data exploration)\n",
    "- `RL_Station_Sub_Problem_2.ipynb` → Special notebook for Sub-Problem 2 (attitude control)\n",
    "- `station_model/` → Python package (core code):\n",
    "  - `_environment.py` → The main model code\n",
    "  - `_sub_problem.py` → Helper functions for sub-problems\n",
    "  - `_hidden_functions.py` → Simulated data for noisy thrusters and drag\n",
    "  - `__init__.py`\n",
    "- `constrained_ppo_orbit.zip`, `my_fancy_system_name_improved.zip` → Pre-generated data/models (will be unzipped automatically)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended – Free GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the Colab badge for the launcher (or any notebook).\n",
    "2. **Enable GPU**:\n",
    "   - Menu: **Runtime → Change runtime type**\n",
    "   - Hardware accelerator → **T4 GPU** (or A100 if available)\n",
    "   - Save\n",
    "3. Run the setup cell at the very top (clones repo, installs packages, adds `station_model` to Python path, unzips data).\n",
    "4. Verify GPU is active:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import torch\n",
    "   print(\"GPU available:\", torch.cuda.is_available())\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Should print True\n",
    "Training will be significantly faster on GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Locally / Offline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Terminal / PowerShell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd path/to/comp_eng/project_handout\n",
    "conda activate compeng\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No extra installation steps needed if you already followed the course environment setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Submit Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the exercises in `RL_Station_Keeping_Handout.ipynb`, save your work in a notebook, score prints and your trained model (.zip file). Your notebooks must be a clean version of the changes needed. Upload an additional .ipynb file for every sub-problem you completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may submit any number of solutions and your best score will count towards your final grade. All files must be submitted in the standard e-mail (sent to `s.endres@iwt.uni-bremen.de`) using template below. Finish all the square brackets with your own data and indicated whether or not you completed each sub-problem (put n/a if you did not attempt it). Attach all relevant files to the e-mail, incomplete submissions will not be graded.\n",
